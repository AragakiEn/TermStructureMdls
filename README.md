# Term Structure Models

Sample code to estimate term structure models.

## Vasicek

### Files
- `vasicekCS3.m`: MATLAB matrix representation of the multi-factor Vasicek model.
- `runvasicek.m`: Run estimation using MATLAB ssm.
- `vasicek.xlsx`: Estimation results.

### Usage

Execute the `runvasicek.m` script in a MATLAB environment. Ensure the following:
1. The `vasicekCS3.m` file is in the same directory.
2. Term structure data (date X maturity) is input properly.

## Cox–Ingersoll–Ross model
